# JESS-CRUD (working)

This is basically a **"Notes App"** but with login for having users.

## Why im making this Project?

This is **my biggest** project until now, the pourpose is the same as "First Try Website" repo
It is to work with some technologies maybe i dont know them all correctly.
But thats the point to experiment and see what i can do in the future with the thing i learn from this.
And then in another project i could do something entirely by my own like in the past with "FirstTryWebsite" and "Art-Human-Expression-Communication_Portfolio"

It is my first time working on backend.

## Technologies (Most Importants):

- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation) -> No frameworks
- Node.js -> Express.js
- HTML/CSS -> HandleBars
- MongoDB -> MongoAtlas

## What you gonna see on this project:

- CRUD
- Session Handling
- Forms
- Views
- Accounts
- Responsive Design
- Frontend Animations

And a lot of things more.
