## What you gonna see on this project:

##### CRUD

You could do all CRUD basic operations

##### Login System

You could have your own account and your personal Notes.

##### Responsive Design & Frontend Animations

As is needed i do a functional responsive web
and also i added some JavaScript animations to make it more interactive

And a lot of things more...

## Why im making this Project?

This is **my biggest** project until now, the pourpose is the same as "First Try Website" repo
It is to work with some technologies maybe i dont know them all correctly.
But thats the point to experiment and see what i can do in the future with the thing i learn from this.
And then in another project i could do something entirely by my own like in the past with "FirstTryWebsite" and "Art-Human-Expression-Communication_Portfolio"

It is my first time working on backend.
