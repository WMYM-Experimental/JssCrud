# JESS-CRUD

## Why im making this Project?

This is my biggest project until now, the pourpose is the same as "First Try Website" repo
It is to work with some technologies maybe i dont know them all correctly.
But thats the point to experiment and see what i can do in the future with the thing i learn from this.
And then in another project i could do something entirely by my own like in the past with "FirstTryWebsite" and "Art-Human-Expression-Communication_Portfolio"

It is my first time working on backend.

## What u gonna see on this project:

- Session Handling
- CRUD
- Forms
- Views
- Accounts
- Responsive Design

## Technologies (Most Importants):

- JavaScript
- Node.js/Express
- HandleBars
- CSS
- MongoDB
